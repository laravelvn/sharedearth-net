            %p Sharing anchors community.
            %p
              In tribal societies, gifts and shared goods create a common bond and sense of belonging.
              We revive these experiences on special occasions like religious ceremonies, weddings
              and birthdays.
            %p
              sharedearth.net celebrates a world where where we can enjoy this sense of belonging
              every day. It's a platform for friends and communities to build trust, share resources and
              contribute to the commons.
            %p
              On sharedearth.net you can share resources or place them into the commons. Shared
              resources are consciously shared at your discretion and subject to return. Goods placed in
              the commons are freely exchanged amongst the people who build and preserve the
              commons.
            %p
              Using the rich reputation information gathered on each member of the sharedearth.net
              community, we can consciously decide with whom to share, and thereby build a commons
              culture where acts of kindness and love are rewarded through deeper trust, greater
              collaboration and stronger community.
            %p
              By practising sharing and commoning, we are breaking cultural patterns of ego-centric
              separation and exclusive property rights and rewriting our cultural and economic stories
              to reflect our emerging experience of universal interconnection
            %p Each act of sharing is a transitional step towards a just and sustainable society.
